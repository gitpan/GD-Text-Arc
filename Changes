    - fixed bugs: 
      - new() should explicitly call my _init
      - _init color was set to colorsTotal - 1 (last defined color).
        This wasn't well defined for true-color GD images, so I set it to 
        the first defined color, or nearly-black for true-color.
      - added tests for making a true-color GD image and a default Arc 
        object.
      - test comparing get->length() against get_length() turned out
        to be wrong on Windows- kerning seems to work differently on
        Windows freetype.  Removed the test because testing kerning
        wasn't terribly useful anyway.
    - interface change:
      - as noted above: default color is now the FIRST defined color
        for indexed images (instead of the LAST defined color), or 
        nearly black (0,0,1), for true-color images (instead of undefined).
